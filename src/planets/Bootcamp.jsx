Are you looking for a friendly place to structure your learning journey and build knowledge in a community-driven environment? Then bootcamp++ might be what you are looking for. Together, we deep-dive into various computer science and software engineering topics which are relevant to our careers. We'll complete practical exercises with peer-reviews, along with occasional workshops from experienced engineers. This is not a course, but rather a pathway you can walk with others, while we rise in our careers together.",
