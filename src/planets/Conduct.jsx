				<p>
					Emma woz ere! All attendees, organisers, facilitators,
					mentors, volunteers, hosts and venue staff involved in Tech
					Risers Women events are required to agree with the following
					code of conduct.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our organisers will enforce this code of conduct at our
					events.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						We value the diversity and inclusion of people who
						identify as women and non-binary, who are often
						underrepresented and marginalised people in tech.
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Be mindful that this will likely be a diverse group, with
					differences ranging from a wide range of religions,
					ethnicities, genders, gender identities, nationalities,
					sexual orientations, body sizes, physical appearance, mental
					abilities and physical abilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use this as an opportunity to respectfully interact with a
					diverse group of individuals in a professional and safe
					environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are all here to learn and grow. Our events, being
					professional and safe, are not the appropriate time and
					place to harass individuals based on their underrepresented
					status.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyone found to be behaving in any way that makes our
					attendees uncomfortable or impedes the intended goals of our
					events will be in violation of this Code of Conduct and will
					be ejected from our events.
				</p>
				<p>
					Offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
					orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
					race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
					intimidation, stalking, following, unwelcome photography or
					recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
					inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
					attention are also considered inappropriate behaviour.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please do not attend our events with the intention to
					recruit for openings in your or your clientâ€™s companies.
					Mentions of available openings are solely allowed to our
					hosts, sponsors and speakers. Should you be found trying to
					actively recruit for your own openings, you will be asked to
					leave.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you or someone else are subjected to inappropriate
					behaviour or have any other concerns please follow the
					Reporting steps below.
